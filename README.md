# Initial biomass of fish stocks from assessments and bias correction - no longer used

This repo contains code to adjust biomass estimates from GOA stock assessments to approximate biomass of younger age classes and biomass in BC based on simple calculations and coarse assumptions. It is based on the no longer used bias corretion for the AK and BC SDMs. This code is archived here as legacy method but is no longer in use.

Expansion of the biomass estimates to the unassessed age classes is now performed [here](https://github.com/somros/Atlantis_GOA_SDM_coupling_and_initbiom).
